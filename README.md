**A minimal model for the unusual circadian system in spiders**

Abstract

We have developed a minimal mathematical model to reproduce the wide range of free-running periods (FRPs) observed in recent recordings of spider locomotor activity. The model also reproduced an experimentally measured spider Phase Response Curve (PRC), presented in this paper for the first time. To simulate these experimental results successfully, the minimal model included a term representing fast inhibition of the spidersâ€™ circadian system by light.  We explored the behavior of the model for both weak and strong circadian oscillators, finding that the bi-stability introduced by the light inhibition term is a key factor enabling these oscillators to reproduce the wide range of FRPs seen in experiment. We found and analyzed several surprising modeling results, which suggested further experiments to both test the applicability of the model and to distinguish between the presence of a weak or strong oscillator in a given spider specie.

Each folder in this repository contains the data and Python script needed to reproduce one figure in the manuscript; note that the Figure 2 directory contains just the Figure 2 image itelf.
