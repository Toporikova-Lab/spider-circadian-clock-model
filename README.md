**A minimal model for the unusual circadian system in spiders**

Abstract

Recordings of spider locomotor activity demonstrate a wide range of free-running periods (FRPs) within and among species. To investigate how the spider circadian clock entrains a wide range of intrinsic periods to the 24-hour solar day, we measured a Phase Response Curve (PRC) for the orb weaver Metazygia wittfeldae, the first PRC recorded for any spider species. We found the PRC includes a region of significant phase advances followed by an abrupt shift to significant phase delays. Such a breakpoint typical of a type 0 PRC indicates an organism should be able to entrain to light-dark cycles with periods significantly different from its endogenous period. Furthermore, we distinguished between two potential biological mechanisms of the entrainment using a mathematical model. To reproduce both the range of entrainment and shape of the PRC, we hypothesized that light inhibits degradation of circadian mRNA.  We explored the behavior of the model for both weak and strong circadian oscillators, finding that the bi-stability introduced by the light inhibition term is a key factor enabling these oscillators to reproduce the wide range of FRPs seen in experiments. We investigated several surprising modeling results, which suggested further experiments to both test the applicability of the model and to distinguish between the presence of a weak or strong oscillator in a given spider species.

Each folder in this repository contains the data and Jupyter notebook file (Python language) needed to reproduce one figure in the manuscript, including the three supplementary figures. Note that the Figure 1 directory contains just the Figure 1 image itelf, which was produced by the software package 'Clocklab' during processing of experimental spider data.
